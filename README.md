```python

import key_finding as kf
import numpy as np

notes = [[12, 0.2], [43, 0.21]] # list of list of pitch and duration

keys = kf.find_key(notes)
# it will return tuples of probabilities â€” major and minor key
# [0.2, 0.6 ...][0.3, 0.3]
# then you can compare it

# for human representstion use `find_key_str()`
kf.find_key_str(notes)

# return somth like "A major" or "D minor"
